Elephant Walk (1954) Starring an early █████ █████ as lord of the manor in some God-forsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad Englishmen, staying out in the midday sun and going berserk. Well eventually they do, after the typhoid or cholera outbreak, of course, and much mayhem ensues. ██████ replaced an ailing ██████ █████ in this pot boiler/adventure flick. When the elephants storm the house and trap ███ on the grand staircase I still get goose bumps. Thank goodness ████ ███████ is around to save the day. One of my favorite guilty pleasures. In color too!
