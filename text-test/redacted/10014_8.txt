The Night Listener held my attention, with █████ ████████ shining as a New York City radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy (████ ██████) who is very ill. ████████ has never met the boy in person, as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone. However, ████████' ex-boyfriend (nice job from █████ █████████) raises doubt about the boy, which prompts ████████ to arrange a meeting with him in person. What follows makes a permanent impact on ████████ in a way he does not expect. I will leave it at that. ████ ████████ also stars.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film, with ████ ████████ giving a memorable portrayal of ██████'s adoptive mother. ██████ ██ also starred as ████████' friend. The Night Listener is inspired by actual events, and it has a somber, almost creepy silence throughout. At times it is predictable, no thanks to some of the reviews I read before seeing the movie and just due to logic, but I liked it anyway. I enjoy ████████ in roles like this, more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me. Recommended. 8/10
