██████ and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories. The music is great, you get a real feel of what the world of █████ looked like (I've been there too), and June gets into the part of ████ █████████ with a passion. Cash's narration is good too.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />1. The actor who played █████ was miscast. 2. There is no edge to the story like Cash puts in some of his faith based music. 3. Because it is uncompelling, I doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again.<br /><br />I'd love to buy the CD.<br /><br />███ █████ █████, USA
