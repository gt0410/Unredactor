The performance by ██ ████, █████ █████, and ████████ ██████████ and the whole chemistry comes off nicely, along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by ██████ ███████. The dialogues by █████ █████████ is also great. <br /><br />I have not seen another movie like this. It is one whole, each piece so nicely fit in the plot. You cannot not be impressed by this movie. <br /><br />Amrish ████ comes off as the bossy husband and 'baap' of ██ ████. ██ ████ is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system. █████████ as ████ ██████ gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain. The first meeting of Anand Velankar with ████ ██████'s at █████████'s place is absoulely stunning. █████ █████ does not play a main role, but her part is also not distracting from the main plot. <br /><br />And to add to this all Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings. Saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble. He is also the 'guru' of ██ ████ and helps him whenever he gets into trouble.<br /><br />The movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody. ██ ████ captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in Ardh Satya. <br /><br />A treat to all avid fans of Indian cinema.
