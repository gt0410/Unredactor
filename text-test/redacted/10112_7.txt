I originally caught this back in 1996 in its one week run at a movie theatre. I was under impressed by it and my feelings haven't much changed.<br /><br />Documentary about the infamous ██████ D. ████ Jr. covering his life and movies. There are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. They include: ███████, ███████ ██████, ████ ██████ Jr., ███████ ████, ███████ ███████ and ████ █████. Interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations. It is interesting (somewhat) but was this really needed? I've seen all of ████'s films and they're just terrible. ████ had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out. I wouldn't say he was the worst director ever but he's down there. ██ we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker? I do like the fact that they didn't try to make ████ out to be some sort of saint. More than a few of those interviewed (especially ██████ Jr.) pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear. Also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s. Still it's of interest if you're a ████ fan. The best interviews are with ███████ (who tears ████ apart) and ███████ ██████ (a long time girlfriend).
