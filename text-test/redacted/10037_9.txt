The ship may have sunk but the movie didn't!!! Director, █████ ███████, from 'The ██████████' did it again with this amazing picture. One of my favorite scenes is 'The Dinner table' scene, in which ████'s family and friends meet ████ after he saves her. ████ has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet 'THE ONE'...I hope I have that look when I am in the room with my future husband.<br /><br />████ and ████ have a connection that is 'MOVIE STUFF' but it's good movie stuff. We have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth. ████ almost commits suicide but the Gilbert Grape star rescues her. I really liked the hanging over the boat scene. It was a good risk.<br /><br />The movie is long but it's fantastic!!! Good story, good flow, good actors!!! Go see it twice if you want, Its worth it!!!
