Well its about time. I had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season's entries. While there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries, at least this episode turned out well. Its rather funny that director ███ ███████ who only has the not bad █████ ████ to his credit and writer ████ ████████ whose only scripting chores to date have included ████ Of The Mummy and █████████ █████ should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season. In "█████ To ███" we are treated to the story of █████ and █████. At the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation. █████ has caught █████ cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back. While they speak, they find themselves in a car accident where █████ is left with only scratches and bruises, but █████ is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire. And this is just the setup people. Once in the hospital █████ must decide whether or not █████ should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes. There's also a side effect too. Every time she flatlines, █████ goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people. Hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever. From the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists I never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it, █████ To ███ should have the right to go on living forever.
