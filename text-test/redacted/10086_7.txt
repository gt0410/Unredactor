This is a lot of silliness about a woman from London who marries a tea planter from Ceylon whom she barely knows. It's full of cliches, and the Liz ██████ character is not believable. It has a marvelous set, some exotic location footage. It shows ██████ at the height of her beauty. She looks stunning.
