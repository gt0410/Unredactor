I think █████ ███████ might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies. Anyway, everyone remembers the RMS ███████. It was big, fast, and "unsinkable"... until April 1912. It was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever. Well █████ ███████ decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship. Well, onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film.<br /><br />So our two main characters are Jack (████████ ████████) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They're not annoying too much but watch this and you'll find out why they could become annoying ( http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn ). The main villain I guess is bad luck, fate, hand of God (no blasphemy intended), or just plain ███████ ███████ (█████ ████). Combine all of the above and what do you get?! Oh yes! We get a love story on a sinking boat. The supporting characters are the following: My personal favorite, Mr. ███████ (██████ ██████)(idk he was so nice), Lovejoy(█████ ██████), Murdoch(Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (████████ ████████), ███████ █████(███████ ████), █████ █████(█████ █████), and many more. We also got the present day treasure hunter, █████ ██████ (████ ██████). They add something to the story, something good. The action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good. In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. She calls and tells her tale on the RMS ███████. Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws. I give ███████, an 86% awesome
