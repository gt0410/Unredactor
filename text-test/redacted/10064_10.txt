The King of Masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship. Set in 1930s China during a time of floods, we meet ████, an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him. When a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends ████, he invites ████ to join their troupe. However, we learn that ████'s family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son. Learning that ████ is childless, ████ is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever. Taking the advice to heart, ████ purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy; he would teach his new son, ██████, the ancient art of silk masks. Soon, ████ discovers a fact about ██████ that threatens the rare and dying art.<br /><br />Together, ████ and ██████ create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it. The story is absorbing. The setting is serene and the costuming simple. Summarily, it is an International Award winning art film which can't help but to move and inspire.
