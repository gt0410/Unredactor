The anime that got me hooked on anime...<br /><br />Set in the year 2010 (hey, that's not too far away now!) the Earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence. Seeing as how crimes are happening ever 30 seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists, the government of the fictional New Port City form the ████ ██████ to deal with the problem - cops with tanks! Oh the insanity!<br /><br />The "heroes" of this series include the new recruit █████ █████, a red haired Japanese woman (yeah I know, they never match their distinctly Japanese names with a Japanese appearance) who has just been drafted into the ████ ██████ and is quickly partnered with blond, blue eyed nice guy ██. █████ is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of ████ ██████ Commander ███████ ███████ (also known as "Brenten"), a big guy who looks like ███ ███████ on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses, a big revolver and a bad temper. ███████ didn't like having █████ join the ████ ██████ in the first place and her wrecking his █████ ███████ (a giant green monster tank) doesn't exactly endear her to him, nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini-tank that she nicknames █████████ and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare "where the boys are more your size" as he puts it. There's also █████, the bifocal genius, Bible quoting/God fearing ████████, purple MO-hawked Mohican, and the pot bellied Chief, who's right on the edge thanks to the Mayor always yelling at him about the ████ ██████ antics. Seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them, they're not very well liked by the people.<br /><br />The "villains" are a cyborg named █████ who's got a mysterious past that's connected with a project known as "Green Peace", his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks ████ & Uni Puma. In the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who haven't been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the 2nd they're hired to steal a painting that is of a naked █████. The story, however, was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic ("Manga") book that's very hard to find.<br /><br />All sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred. This is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it, you'd better go get ███████ █████████. Uneven in places but still a lot of fun.<br /><br />Followed by "New Dominion: ████ ██████".
