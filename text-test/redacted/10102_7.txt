I have to start saying it has been a long time since I have seen it, but have seen it 5 or more times; a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical/comedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence. ███ █████'s mysteries would be a good example.<br /><br />Having █████ █████ unleashed is the best part of the show, as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action, doing a fine job of support. ████ O'Brien plays the face, █████ ███████ the part rumor has it that was offered to ███ ████████ and thus, ██████ and ████████ replacing the leads. Don't know if that was true.<br /><br />all in all, a pleasant movie, but important to have that much █████ █████ and his band on film for history. Wish that it was released, as I haven't seen or heard of it now in two decades. Hope it is not lost
