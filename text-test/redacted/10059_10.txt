This movie is the best film ever. I can't remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me. with a tear in my eye, I admire this movie. It has all the elements that a good movie must have: Excellent █████████, █████, Acting, Story/Plot. A story of friendship, courage, kindliness and loyalty between a Street performing who famous to The King of █████ and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar. Little girl liked to be his granddaughter and King of █████ liked a grandson. They were not conventional in real. Every scene they were together was priceless. The camera work is flawless and grips you. The acting is inspired. Xu ███ was Excellent as The King of █████. Renying ████ "Doggie" looks pretty and played her character very well. ███████ ████ as █████ ███ ████ was great. He played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well. If you have't this movie, try it once, Do watch it.
