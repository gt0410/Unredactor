██ Grot is a very good film. The great plot comes from the novel by ███ ██████, who also adapted this story for the screen. Some really top-class acting, not only by ███ ████, but especially by ██████ ███████, who mostly did TV-work prior to his performance of ████ van de █████. The film seems to kick of as a thriller, and sets an excellent mood. Then we start to learn about ████ ██████ and ████ van de █████, and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash-back structure, which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character-driven drama of the movie. In the end this all culminates into an emotional ending, that will grab audiences by their throats. Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie. A must-see, especially if you liked 'Spoorloos' (The Vanishing's original screen adaptation).
