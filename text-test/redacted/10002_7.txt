This is easily the most underrated film inn the ██████ cannon. Sure, its flawed. It does not give a realistic view of homelessness (unlike, say, how ███████ ████ gave a realistic view of lounge singers, or ███████ gave a realistic view of Italians YOU IDIOTS). Many of the jokes fall flat. But still, this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not, and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive. Its not The Fisher King, but its not crap, either. My only complaint is that ██████ should have cast someone else in the lead (I love ███ as a Director and ██████, not so much as a lead).
