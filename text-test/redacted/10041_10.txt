Back in 1997, do I remember that year: ███████ bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the ███████ won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of ███████, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected ███████ to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that ████ and ████ shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that ███████ could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that ████████'s real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, ███████ is a great movie, best movie of all time, no, just depends on your idea of a good movie, but ███████ delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage.<br /><br />The film starts with █████ ██████ and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS ███████, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude, wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the ███████ sank. 101-year-old ████ ██████ ███████ learns of the drawing, and contacts ██████ to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. She and her granddaughter █████████ "Lizzy" ███████ visit ██████ and his skeptical team on his salvage ship. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, ████ ███████ recalls her memories aboard the ███████, revealing for the first time that she was ████ ██████ ███████. In 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old ████ boards the ship with her fiancé, ███ ███████ and her mother, ████ ██████ ███████, both of whom stress the importance of ████'s engagement to ███ since the marriage will mean the eradication of the Dewitt-███████ debts: while they have the outward appearance of the upper-class, ████ and her mother are financially broke. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling ███ and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage, ████ attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named ████ ██████ intervenes. ████ and ████ strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first-class formal dinner of the rapport-building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of Irish dance, music and beer in third-class. But after ███'s servant informs him of ████'s whereabouts', ████ is forbidden from seeing ████ again. However, after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven-year-old daughter to behave like a "proper lady" at tea, ████ defies him and her mother, asking ████ to sketch her nude and wearing only the Heart of the Ocean, an engagement present from ███. After a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time, they go to the deck of the ship.<br /><br />They then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg. After overhearing the ship's lookouts discussing how serious the collision is, ████ tells ████ they should warn her mother and ███. Meanwhile, ███ discovers ████'s nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe, so he frames ████ for stealing the Heart of the Ocean by having ███████ plant it in ████'s pocket. Upon learning ███ intends to leave ████ to die below deck, ████ runs away from him and her mother to rescue him. ████ and ████ return to the top deck. ███ and ████, though enemies, both want ████ safe, so they persuade her to board a lifeboat. But after realizing that she cannot leave ████, ████ jumps back on the ship and reunites with ████ in the ship's first class staircase. ████ and ████ return to the top deck, the lifeboats have gone, and the ship finally goes down into the freezing Atlantic taking ████ and ████ down.<br /><br />So does ███████ live up to it's hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie. But it has great acting, amazing effects, a well-written story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of ███'s baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. It will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too seeing that I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. But all that aside, I do recommend this movie, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.<br /><br />10/10
