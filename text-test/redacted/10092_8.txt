The scintillating █████████ ██████ stars in this lesser-known classic as a young girl from London who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from British Ceylon (current day ███ █████). Upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd. ███████ ████████, who also directed The Life Of █████ ████ and Portrait Of Jennie , does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark, and almost eerie, undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful I've seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery.
