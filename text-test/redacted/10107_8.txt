"████ █████" is one of the finest film ever made in Indian ██████. Directed by the great director ██████ ████████, this one is the most successful ████ ███████ ████████ ██████ which also turned out to be a Commercial Success. Even today, ████ █████ is an inspiration for all leading directors of India.<br /><br />The film tells the Real-life Scenario of ██████ ██████ of the 70s. Unlike any ██████ of other cities in India, ██████ ██████ encompasses a Different system altogether. ██████ ████████ creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of ██████ ██████ Environment.<br /><br />Amongst various ██████ officers & colleagues, the film describes the story of █████ ████████, a young hot-blooded Cop coming from a poor family. His father is a harsh ██████ Constable. █████ himself suffers from his father's ideologies & incidences of his father's Atrocities on his mother. █████'s approach towards immediate action against crime, is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction. The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein █████'s constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.This leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired Job-satisfaction. Resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars, also turning him to an alcoholic.<br /><br />The Spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the system of the Metro, where the ██████ & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end. His compromise towards unethical practice is negative. Finally he gets suspended.<br /><br />The Direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when █████ breaks in the Underworld gangster ████ ██████'s house to arrest him, followed by short conversation which is fantastic. At many scenes, the film has Hair-raising moments.<br /><br />The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch. Alcoholism, Corruption, █████████ █████████, Courage, Deceptions all are integral part of ██████ police even today. Those aspects are dealt brilliantly.<br /><br />Finally, the films belongs to the One man show, ██ ████ portraying █████ ████████ traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.
