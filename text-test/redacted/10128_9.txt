Here it is.. the first EVER episode of Friends, Where we get introduced to Control Freak ██████ ██████ (████████ Cox), Newly divorced ████ ██████ (█████ ████████), █████ ██████ ██████ (████ Kudrow), unknown actor and ladies man (████ ██ █████ and very sarcastic ████████ ████ (███████ █████). This is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the 6th and final friend ██████ kid ██████ █████ (Jennifer Aniston).<br /><br />The Episode is better than most people give credit for, like any new sitcom the first episode isn't always fantastic. The acting in this episode isn't great because the cast cannot identify and arnt really believable in their new characters (apart from Kudrow and █████- who shine).<br /><br />████ ██ █████- Man, his acting was down right dreadful because until later, he gets more confident, but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails.<br /><br />█████ ████████- Why does he over pronounce EVERY word? he cannot speak normally! but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons, but he isn't confident. and i cannot sympathise with him Jennifer Aniston- Looks hot, and does a good job as ██████ █████, but we only see the real ██████ later in the 1st season, ████████ Cox- Looks quite anorexic in this episode, its worrying, she looks totally different now, (more healthily), she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this 20 minute pilot! ████ Kudrow and ███████ █████- I'm doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb, and for ████ this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as ██████ (Pheebs) and ███████ █████ is just ███████ █████ playing himself basically! The episode quality does improve later,,, such as the Sets, they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly, the acting is OK, the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot! I hope we see the Friends reunite! cause they will always be there for us!
