Masters of ██████: █████ to ███ starts late one night as married couple ████ (█████ ████████) & ████ ███████ (██████ ███████) are driving home, however while talking █████ is distracted & crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road. █████'s airbag works OK & he walks away with minor injuries, unfortunately for ████ hers didn't & she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car & doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body. ████'s life is saved, just. She is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured & horribly disfigured from the burns. █████ decides that she should die, his selfish lawyer Ira (Corbin Bersen) thinks they should let ████ die, sue the car manufacturer & get rich while ████'s mum Pam (█████ ████████) wants to blame █████, get rich & save ████. However ████ has other plans of her own...<br /><br />This American Canadian co-production was directed by ███ ███████ (whose only horror film previously was █████ ████ (2003) which on it's own hardly qualifies him to direct a Masters of ██████ episode) & was episode 9 from season 2 of the Masters of ██████ TV series, while I didn't think █████ to ███ was the best Masters of ██████ episode I've seen I thought it was a decent enough effort all the same & still doesn't come close to being as bad as The Screwfly Solution (2006). The script by ████ ████████ has a neat central idea that isn't anything new but it uses it effectively enough although I'd say it's a bit uneven, the first 15 minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for 20 odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over ████'s life & the affair █████ is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory & twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart. The character's are a bit clichéd, the weak man, the bent lawyer, the protective mum & the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough, the dialogue is OK, the story moves along at a nice pace & overall I liked █████ to ███ apart from a few minutes here & there where it loses it's focus a bit & I wasn't that keen on the ambiguous ending.<br /><br />Director ███████ does a good job & there are some effective scenes, this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere & out-and-out blood & gore. There are some fantastic special make-up effects as usual, there's shots of ████ where she has had all of the skin burned off her body & the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross (images & make-up effects that reminded me of similar scenes in Hellraiser (1987) & it's sequels), then there's the main course at the end where █████ literally skins someone complete with close-ups of scalpels slicing skin open & him peeling it off the muscle & putting it into a cooler box! Very messy. There are also various assorted body parts. There's some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked...<br /><br />Technically █████ to ███ is excellent, the special effects are brilliant & as most Masters of ██████ episodes it doesn't look like a cheap made-for-TV show which basically if the truth be told it is. The acting was fine but there's no big 'names' in this one.<br /><br />█████ to ███ is another enjoyable & somewhat twisted Masters of ██████ episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene! Well worth a watch... for those with the stomach.
