In this first episode of Friends, we are introduced to the 6 main characters of the series: ██████ ██████,██████ ██████,████████ ████,████ ██████, ████ █████████ and eventually ██████ █████ .<br /><br />We discover that ██████, a rich girl that is ██████'s friend from high school times, left her fiancé, █████, at the altar, since she discovered she didn't love him. She also decides to live with ██████ and become independent from her father,getting a new job as a waitress in Central Perk.<br /><br />████, for the other hand,discovered his wife is a lesbian and lost her for █████, her partner. (We see him moving to a new apartment during the episode)<br /><br />██████, in this episode, makes out (and eventually sleeps) with ████ "the wine guy", who gave her the excuse of being impotent since he divorced his wife. But in reality, he was just deceiving her.<br /><br />Ps: I just loooove ████'s and ████████'s haircuts in this first season! =)
