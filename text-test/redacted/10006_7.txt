In this "critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events, ███████ (█████ ████████), a celebrated writer and late-night talk show host, becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother (████ ████████). When troubling questions arise about this boy's (story), however, ███████ finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret" according to film's official synopsis.<br /><br />You really should STOP reading these comments, and watch the film NOW...<br /><br />The "How did he lose his leg?" ending, with Ms. ████████ planning her new life, should be chopped off, and sent to "deleted scenes" land. It's overkill. The true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious, by the time Mr. ████████ returns to New York. Possibly, her blindness could be in question - but a revelation could have be made certain in either the "highway" or "video tape" scenes. The film would benefit from a re-editing - how about a "director's cut"? <br /><br />████████ and █████ █████████ (as Jess) don't seem, initially, believable as a couple. A scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage. Otherwise, the cast is exemplary. ████████ offers an exceptionally strong characterization, and not a "gay impersonation". ██████ ██ (as ████), ███ ██████ (as Ashe), and ████ ██████ (████ ██████) are all perfect.<br /><br />Best of all, ████████'s "█████" belongs in the creepy hall of fame. Ms. ██ is correct in saying ████████ might be, "you know, like that guy from 'Psycho'." There have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women, due to a slighter dispersion of roles; certainly, they could have noticed ████████ with some award consideration. She is that good. And, director ███████ ████████ definitely evokes █████████ - he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful.<br /><br />Finally, writers ████████, █████████ ██████, and █████ ████████ deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere.<br /><br />******* The Night Listener (1/21/06) ███████ ████████ ~ █████ ████████, ████ ████████, ██████ ██, ████ ██████
