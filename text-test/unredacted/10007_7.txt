THE NIGHT LISTENER (2006) **1/2 █████ ████████, ████ ████████, █████ █████████, ████ ██████, ███ ██████, ██████ ██, ████ ██████, ████ █████, █████ ███ █████. (Dir: ███████ ████████) <br /><br />Hitchcockian suspenser gives ████████ a stand-out low-key performance.<br /><br />What is it about celebrities and fans? What is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm? <br /><br />In the latest derange fan scenario, based on true events no less, ████████ stars as a talk-radio personality named ███████ ██ one, who reads stories he's penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named ████ ██████ (██████) who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to ██ one's editor Ashe (██████) who gives it to ██ one to read for himself. <br /><br />██ one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of ████ being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named █████ (████████ giving an excellent performance) who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with ██ one reveals that ████ is dying from AIDS. Naturally ██ one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover Jess (█████████) whose sudden departure from their New York City apartment has ██ one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into █████ and ████'s backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn't anticipate.<br /><br />Written by █████████ ██████ (who co-wrote the screenplay with his former lover █████ ████████ and the film's novice director ████████) and based on a true story about a fan's hoax found out has some Hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot-boiler does. It helps that ████████ gives a stand-out, low-key performance as the conflicted good-hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him (the one thing that has escaped his own reality) and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy ████████ whose one physical trait I will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core.<br /><br />However the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by ████████, it pays to listen to your own inner voice: be careful of what you hope for.
