This isn't the comedic █████ ████████, nor is it the quirky/insane █████ ████████ of recent thriller fame. This is a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization, mixed with █████'s new love of the thriller. But this isn't a thriller, per se. This is more a mystery/suspense vehicle through which ████████ attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper.<br /><br />Also starring ██████ ██ and ████ ██████, this Suspense Drama plays pretty much like a news report, until ███████'s character gets close to achieving his goal.<br /><br />I must say that I was highly entertained, though this movie fails to teach, guide, inspect, or amuse. It felt more like I was watching a guy (████████), as he was actually performing the actions, from a third person perspective. In other words, it felt real, and I was able to subscribe to the premise of the story.<br /><br />All in all, it's worth a watch, though it's definitely not Friday/Saturday night fare.<br /><br />It rates a 7.7/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
