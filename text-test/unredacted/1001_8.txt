Somewhat funny and well-paced action thriller that has █████ ████ as a hapless, fast-talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding U.S. Treasury Agent (█████ █████) to be released on the streets of New York to find a picky computer thief/hacker (████ ██████████), who stole forty-two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead.<br /><br />"Bait" marks the sophomore feature for ███████ █████ ("The Replacement Killers") and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesn't top his first movie. What the two films have in common is the action sequences, which are flat-out excellent.<br /><br />████ is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning, but throughout the film, I began to catch on. ██████████ is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as ████ █████████ and patient as the late Laurence ███████ was in "████████ ███". █████ is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost.
