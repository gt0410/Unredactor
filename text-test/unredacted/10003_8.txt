This is not the typical ███ ██████ film. It was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable. ██████ ███ ██████ made the movie, she is such a fantastic, under-rated actress. There were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more, and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so, but all in all, this is worth the price to rent and see it. The acting was good overall, ██████ himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience. Again, ██████ was the best actor in the movie, but "Fume" and "Sailor" both played their parts well.
