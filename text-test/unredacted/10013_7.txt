Like one of the previous commenters said, this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery. Such a waste because ████████'s performance was eerie and ████████ was believable. I just kept waiting for it to get better. I don't think it was bad editing or needed another director, it could have just been the film. It came across as a Canadian movie, something like the first few seasons of X-Files. Not cheap, just hokey. Also, it needed a little more suspense. Something that makes you jump off your seat. The movie reached that moment then faded away; kind of like a false climax. I can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the "reality" of the story but I thought that part was reached when ███████ was in the hospital looking for the boy. This movie needs to have a Director's cut that tries to fix these problems.
