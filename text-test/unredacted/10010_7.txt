There are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times. Constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of Pyschosis, have kept psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades. Occasionally, some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence. That is the premise of the film entitled " The Night Listner." It tells the story of a popular radio host called ███████ ████ (█████ ████████) who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about Gay lifestyles. Perhaps its because his show is losing it's authentic veneer which causes ████ to admit he is no longer himself. Feeling abandoned by both his lover Jess (█████ █████████) and his and best friend (███ ██████), he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation. It is here, a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help. ████ needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called █████ (████ ██████). In reading the boy's harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents, ████ is captivated and wants to help. However, things are not what they seem and ████ soon finds himself en-wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare. This movie is pure █████ ████████ and were it not for ████ ████████ who plays █████ D. ██████, ██████ ██ as ████ and ████ ██████ as pop, this might be comical. Instead, this may prove to be one of ███████'s more serious performances. ***
