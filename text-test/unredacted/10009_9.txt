When I first read █████████ ███████ story I was taken in by the human drama displayed by ███████ ██ one and those he cares about and loves. That being said, we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of Hollywood...<br /><br />Writer █████████ ██████ and director ███████ ████████ have truly succeeded! <br /><br />With just the right amount of restraint █████ ████████ captures the fragile essence of ███████ and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life(Jess) and the world around him(█████).<br /><br />As we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably. The request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps ███████ find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward.<br /><br />It's to bad that most people will avoid this film. I only say that because the average American will probably think "█████ ████████ in a serious role? That didn't work before!" PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE! █████ ████████ touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people. Like his movie One Hour Photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art.<br /><br />Oh and before I forget, I believe █████ █████████ as Jess steals every scene he is in. He has the 1940's leading man looks and screen presence. It's this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now!!<br /><br />S~
