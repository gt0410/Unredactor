Popular radio storyteller ███████ ██ one(█████ ████████,scraggy and speaking in hushed,hypnotic tones) becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen-year-old boy from █████████ named ████ ██████(████ ██████),who has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents. To boot,████ has AIDS and this compels ███████ further still,since his partner Jess(█████ █████████,good)happens to be a survivor of HIV himself. <br /><br />He also acquaints himself with ████'s guardian,a woman named █████(Toni Collette,brilliant!)and when ███████ decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to █████████,he discovers some secrets he was(naturally)not prepared to find.<br /><br />Based on real events that happened to █████████ ██████(who co-wrote the screenplay with █████ ████████)and directed by ███████ ███████,this film moves a lot faster(90 min.,maybe a few minutes longer)than one might think a movie of this genre would run. That's good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear. It's bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesn't sew-up any of the plot openings or back-story. I'd rather not go into any great detail except to say that,if you are not familiar with █████████'s works or his personal story,you feel a little bit out of the loop here. Still,the performances by ████████( I would've loved to heard more of his narration,personally),Collette,█████████,██████ and much of the supporting cast(the Waitress at the restaurant ███████'s █████ frequents does a great job with what small part she has!)are top-notch and the mood established here--namely,the chilly,lonely dark exteriors of █████████ and New York--give a terrific framing for this story. It may have ends that don't tie together particularly well,but it's still a compelling enough story to stick with.
