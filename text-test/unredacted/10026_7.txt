Without ███████ ██████ this project needn't have been completed. However with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is ████ ██████ I would definitely recommend it. It looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance. ██████'s dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but his few scenes didn't detract from being entertained. Mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line, the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster. The charismatic ██████ delivery and timing were impeccable and believable. She plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be. I wish I had seen this on the big screen but alas I was fortunate to rent it before it was lost.
